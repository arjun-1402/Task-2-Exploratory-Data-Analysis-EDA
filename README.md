# Task-2-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA

This project explores the Titanic dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. It focuses on understanding the data through summary statistics, visual exploration, and basic inferences. The dataset is first examined for structure and missing values, followed by statistical summaries and visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, pairplots, and correlation matrices to uncover insights about survival rates and feature relationships.

The visualizations help identify key patterns in the data, including how factors like age, class, fare, and gender impacted survival. Plotly is used for interactive charts, providing deeper insights into the distribution and relationships of variables. This analysis forms the foundation for further modeling or feature engineering tasks in a machine learning pipeline.
